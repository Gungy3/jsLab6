# jsLab6
My files for Javascript lab 6. It's nothing special, but hey, it's here!
The main .js is StudyBuddy.js, which takes a user's inputs on a form to determine if I personally would think they would be a good study buddy. 
Other than that, further documentation is located in each file, it's late so I'm not going to rewrite every comment put into the files.
